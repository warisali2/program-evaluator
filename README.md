## Introduction
While practicing for Programming Competitions, Have you ever been in a situation where you had to enter inputs again and again for every change you made in your code? It really gets tiring, doesn't it? This is where **pe** helps you! It automates the testing of program by saving you from the trouble of manually inputing data.
